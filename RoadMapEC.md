1. Improved Negation Handling:
Goal: More accurately handle negation to avoid misinterpreting the sentiment of phrases like "not happy" or "didn't enjoy."

Methods:

Wider Negation Window: Extend the negation effect to more than just the immediately following word (e.g., a window of 2-3 words).

Dependency Parsing: Use a dependency parser (like spaCy) to identify the grammatical relationships between words. This is much more accurate than a fixed window. For example, in "I did not find the movie enjoyable," a dependency parser would correctly link "not" to "enjoyable," even though they are not adjacent.

Example Prompt: "How can I improve the negation handling in my Python sentiment analysis code? I'm currently using a simple flag to invert the sentiment of the next word after a negation word (like 'not'), but this isn't accurate enough. I'd like to explore using a wider window, and ideally, I'd like to use dependency parsing with spaCy to identify the words being negated more accurately. Provide code examples using spaCy, and explain how to integrate it into my existing preprocess_text and analyze_sentiment functions."

2. Contextual Word Embeddings (BERT):
Goal: Move beyond simple word matching and capture the meaning of words in context.

Method: Use a pre-trained BERT model (or similar transformer-based model) to generate contextual word embeddings.

Example Prompt: "I want to improve my sentiment analysis by using contextual word embeddings. I've heard that BERT is a good choice. How can I integrate a pre-trained BERT model into my existing Python code to generate word embeddings, and how would I use those embeddings to calculate sentiment scores? Provide a code example that shows how to load a BERT model (using the transformers library), get embeddings for words in a sentence, and then use those embeddings, along with my existing emotion lexicon, to calculate sentiment. I want the approach to be compatible with eventual use in a PySpark environment."

3. Weighted Scoring and Normalization:
Goal: Improve the scoring mechanism to be more nuanced than a simple sum.

Methods:

TF-IDF: Weight words by their Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). This gives more weight to words that are frequent in a document but relatively rare in the overall corpus.

Normalization: Divide the emotion scores by the total number of (processed) words in the text to account for different text lengths.

Custom Weights: Experiment with assigning different weights to different emotion categories, or to specific words.

Example Prompt: "How can I improve the sentiment scoring in my Python code? Currently, I'm just summing the emotion scores from my lexicon. I'd like to explore weighting words by TF-IDF and normalizing the scores by the length of the text. Show me how to calculate TF-IDF scores for the words in my text and use those scores to weight the emotion scores from the lexicon."

4. Converting fully to PySpark Dataframes
This allows for larger files and datasets to be processed

Make use of the full functionality of the Fabric environment.

5. Machine Learning:
Goal: Move beyond lexicon-based analysis to a more powerful, data-driven approach.

Methods: Train a machine learning classifier (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, or a neural network) on a labeled dataset of text with known sentiment/emotion labels. Use the lexicon scores, word embeddings, and other features (n-grams, POS tags) as input to the classifier.

Example prompt: What would be the best approach to use machine learning with the current code, so that the emotion of a text is detected.

Choose one of these areas to focus on in your next prompt. Don't try to do everything at once. Start with negation handling, as that's a relatively self-contained improvement that will have a noticeable impact on accuracy. Then, you can move on to more advanced techniques like contextual embeddings and machine learning.
